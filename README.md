# C-Bitwise-Operator

**Experiment 4: Bitwise Operators in C++**

**Title of the Experiment:**
To study and implement bitwise operators in C++

**Objective / Aim:**
To understand and apply bitwise operators like AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, and right shift on integer values in C++.

**Tools and Software Used:**

* Code::Blocks IDE or Visual Studio Code
* GCC Compiler (MinGW or g++)
* Operating System: Windows or Linux

**Theory:**
Bitwise operators in C++ are used to manipulate individual bits of data. These operators work only on integer data types.
They include:

* `&` (AND): Sets bit to 1 if both bits are 1
* `|` (OR): Sets bit to 1 if either bit is 1
* `^` (XOR): Sets bit to 1 if only one of the bits is 1
* `~` (NOT): Inverts all the bits
* `<<` (Left Shift): Shifts bits to the left by a certain number of positions
* `>>` (Right Shift): Shifts bits to the right by a certain number of positions

Bitwise operations are often used in low-level programming, such as device drivers, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.

**Algorithm:**

1. Start the program
2. Declare two integer variables
3. Input values from the user
4. Perform bitwise operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, right shift
5. Display the results
6. End the program

**Flowchart (text description):**
Start → Input values → Apply bitwise operators → Show results → End

**Conclusion:**
The program executed successfully and produced correct results for all bitwise operations. This experiment helped in understanding how binary-level operations are performed in C++ using bitwise operators.
